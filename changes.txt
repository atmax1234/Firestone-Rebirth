Models Folder: added new models for the mongoose schema.
Commands Folder: Re-organized the folders adder an Information folder and removed the Public folder. The Ping Command is now in the Developer Folder with a developer only option enabled.
Installed a new package called "discordjs-button-pagination-v2" to handle paginated embeds in discord
Changed the "daily" command to use the 'humanizeDuration' package instead of 'pretty-ms' because of a module type error.

Whats left is to finish the help command but first I should run a test on it to see if it console logs the name and description for the commands.
